# Smart Hub Ultra

Smart Hub Ultra is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for creating, managing, and testing AI bots. It combines an approachable UI, offline support, and advanced features like Behavioral DNA mapping, real-time collaboration, and AR/voice interaction modes.

This repository contains a mostly client-side app (HTML + JS) that uses Firebase for backend services. The project already includes pages, a service worker, and numerous feature modules under `js/`.

## Quick highlights
- PWA-ready: `manifest.json` + `sw.js` included
- Modular JS in `js/` (auth, bots, dashboard, collab, etc.)
- CLI entry `cli.js` for simple scripts and automation

## Quick start (developer)
1. Install Node.js (LTS) and npm.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run dev server (Parcel):

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

5. Preview the built site:

```bash
npm run preview
```

6. Useful commands

```bash
npm run lint    # run ESLint (non-fatal)
npm run format  # run Prettier to format files
npm run clean   # remove build artifacts
```

## Cloud Functions (Admin + Maintenance)
Transactional invites, secure admin claims, and scheduled cleanup now live in Firebase Functions.

1. **Install backend dependencies**

  ```bash
  cd functions
  npm install
  cd ..
  ```

2. **Configure runtime secrets** (adjust values for your project):

  ```bash
  firebase functions:config:set \
    admin.manual_secret="SMARTHUB-EXEC-2025" \
    sendgrid.api_key="SG.your-key" \
    sendgrid.from="no-reply@smarthubultra.dev" \
    app.signin_url="https://smarthubultra.web.app" \
    cleanup.guest_ttl_ms="172800000" \
    cleanup.session_ttl_ms="172800000"
  ```

  - `admin.manual_secret` must match the override code admins type client-side.
  - Omit the SendGrid keys to rely on manual invite links only.
  - `app.signin_url` is the base page appended to all generated magic links.
  - Cleanup TTLs (ms) control how long guest accounts and sessions persist.

3. **Deploy or run locally**

  ```bash
  firebase deploy --only functions
  # or
  firebase emulators:start --only functions
  ```

4. **Optional client override** — set a custom Functions base URL (non-default regions, staging environments, etc.).

  ```html
  <script>window.SMART_HUB_FUNCTIONS_URL = 'https://us-central1-your-project.cloudfunctions.net';</script>
  ```

  When left unset, the app defaults to `https://us-central1-${projectId}.cloudfunctions.net`.

## Example: create or inspect the demo bot
An example bot template is included at `bots/exampleBot.json`. Use it as a starting point for bot creation or tests.

## Project structure (selected)
- `index.html` – main entry page
- `js/` – app modules (auth.js, main.js, bots.js, etc.)
- `bots/` – bot data/blueprints (added example)
- `cli.js` – CLI helper
- `manifest.json`, `sw.js` – PWA support

## Development notes and next improvements
- Convert modules in `js/` to ES module imports and a single `src/` entry to enable modern bundlers (optional).
- Add unit tests for core modules (bots, behavioralDNA) and a CI workflow (already added).
- Add integration tests or Playwright for end-to-end flows (signup, bot creation).

## New features added in this iteration
- Firebase compatibility shim (`js/firebase-compat.js`) to provide legacy `window.firebase` behavior while migrating to the modular SDK.
- Central modular Firebase config: `js/firebaseConfig.js`.
- Vibe Quiz: a simple psychometric-like quiz at the top of the auth page (module: `js/vibeQuiz.js`) that writes into `behavioral_dna/`.
- Plugin scaffold: `plugins/analytics/` (dashboard stub + README).
- UX polish: dark mode toggle and basic voice command toggle (emits `voice-command` events).
- Audit tooling: `scripts/audit.js` produces `audit-report.md` and CI uploads it automatically.
- Simulation harness: `scripts/simulateSessions.js` — run locally to simulate session timings.

## How to try the new pieces locally
- Run the dev server and open the app. Complete the Vibe Quiz on the landing/auth page.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Run audit locally:

```bash
node scripts/audit.js
# opens/writes audit-report.md
```

- Run the local simulation (quick):

```bash
node scripts/simulateSessions.js 1000 50
# simulate 1000 sessions with concurrency 50
```

## Vision: digital twins and next steps
This branch of changes is the first step toward pivoting Smart Hub Ultra into a digital-twin platform: users spawn agents that reflect their vibe, preferences, and data. Next steps:
- Build a more thorough Vibe Quiz with validated psychometric items and map scores to richer Behavioral DNA.
- Design the Hybrid Memory Core: short-term in-memory cache, mid-term local IndexedDB, long-term vector embeddings (e.g., Pinecone/FAISS) and a graph DB for context graphs.
- Add a pluggable-brain API so users can choose OpenAI, Llama, Claude, or on-prem models by plugin.
- Add a richer plugin marketplace and dashboard system.
