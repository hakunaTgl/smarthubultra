Smart Hub Ultra

Smart Hub Ultra is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for creating, managing, and testing AI bots. It features a responsive interface optimized for Android devices, real-time collaboration, bot templates, and advanced oversight with Behavioral DNA Mapping to ensure bots stay on track. This project uses Firebase for backend services and IndexedDB for local storage, making it accessible online and offline.

Features





Bot Creation & Management: Build bots visually or via code with templates and a marketplace.



Authentication: Secure sign-up, sign-in, and password recovery with clear error messages (e.g., "Invalid Password").



Dashboard: Displays weather, AI insights, and daily challenges, optimized for mobile.



Real-Time Collaboration: Live chat and code diffing for team projects.



Bot Oversight: Behavioral DNA Mapping and predictive tasks to detect rogue behavior.



Mobile Accessibility: Runs as a PWA on Android with swipe gestures and offline support.



Innovative Tools: Holographic guide, AR control mode, voice commands, and meme-driven inspiration.

Prerequisites





A modern web browser (Chrome recommended for PWA support).



Node.js and npm (for local testing).



A Firebase project for backend services.



An Android device for mobile use (optional but recommended).

Setup Instructions





Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-hub-ultra.git
cd smart-hub-ultra



Install Dependencies:

npm install



Set Up Firebase:





Create a Firebase project at console.firebase.google.com.



Enable Realtime Database and Authentication (Email/Password).



Copy your Firebase config object and replace the placeholders in js/main.js:

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};



Run Locally:

npx http-server

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.



Install as a PWA:





Open the app in Chrome on your Android device.



Tap the menu and select "Add to Home Screen" to install the PWA.



Access the app offline once the Service Worker is registered.



Test and Deploy:





Test features like bot creation, collaboration, and notifications.



Deploy to a hosting service like Firebase Hosting or Netlify:

firebase deploy

Command-Line Interface
----------------------
Use the CLI to create bot blueprints or run Node.js tasks.

```
npm run cli init-bot myBot
npm run cli run-task ./scripts/sampleTask.js
```

This will create `bots/myBot.json` with a basic structure or execute the specified script.

File Structure





index.html: Main HTML file with modal-based UI.



js/:





main.js: Initializes Firebase, Service Worker, and app navigation.
bots.html and dashboard.html provide pages for bot management and the dashboard.



auth.js: Manages user authentication and support tickets.



bots.js: Handles bot creation, templates, and marketplace.



dashboard.js: Loads dashboard widgets and insights.



(Other JS files for additional features like collaboration, AR mode, etc.)



css/style.css: Styles for glassmorphic UI and mobile responsiveness.



manifest.json: Configures PWA settings.



sw.js: Service Worker for offline support.

Usage





Sign Up/Sign In:





Use the Auth modal to create an account or sign in.



Look for clear error messages like "Invalid Password" if issues arise.



Create a Bot:





Navigate to the Bots modal.



Use a template or write custom code, then save with Behavioral DNA validation.



Test Bots:





Go to the Playground modal to test bots with live input or battle them.



Check for rogue behavior alerts from Predictive Tasks.



Collaborate:





Invite users in the Collab Hub for real-time coding and chat.



Explore Features:





Use the Holographic Guide for setup help.



Try AR Control Mode or Voice Commands for advanced interaction.

Troubleshooting





Service Worker Failure: Ensure sw.js is in the root directory and paths in main.js are correct.



Firebase Errors: Verify your Firebase config and enable Realtime Database rules.



Login Issues: Check for error messages like "Not Set Up Yet" and ensure email/password are correct.



Preview Error: Confirm all DOM elements exist in index.html and JS file paths start with /js/.
