# Analytics plugin (stub)

This folder contains a minimal analytics plugin scaffold to demonstrate the plugin architecture.

Files:
- `index.html` — simple dashboard stub that can be loaded inside the app or opened separately.
- `analytics.js` — example code that reads events from `analytics/` or `tracking/` in Firebase and renders counts.

Purpose: show how plugins can be dropped into `plugins/` and loaded by the main app. Replace with richer dashboards (React/Vue) as needed.
